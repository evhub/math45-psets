\begin{problem}[E1]
    For each of the following differential equations,
    find its general solution and the solution for 
    the given initial condition:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item $y''+y'-2y= 2t,\quad y(0)= 0,\quad y'(0)= 1$
        \item $y''-2y'+y= te^t+4,\quad y(0)= 1,\quad y'(0)= 1$

    For each of the following differential equations,
